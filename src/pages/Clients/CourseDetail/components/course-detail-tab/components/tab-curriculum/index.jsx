        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Your ability to use type is one of the things that differentiates graphic design
          from other visual professions. A big part of graphic design is understanding
          typography, developing your knowledge of typefaces, and how to apply them in
          your design. This will be a constant study throughout your career.
